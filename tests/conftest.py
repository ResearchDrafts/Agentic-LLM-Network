    autospec so a signature change in ModelGateway breaks these tests rather
    than silently passing. Note generate() is NOT reassigned to a bare
    AsyncMock: create_autospec already produces an AsyncMock for async
    methods, and overwriting it would throw away exactly the signature
    enforcement autospec exists to provide. Only the return value is set.
    (tests/test_factories.py pins this behaviour, since getting it wrong is
    silent: the fixture still works, it just stops catching drift.)

    supports_vision and model_backend_id are set explicitly because both are
    plain instance attributes assigned in __init__, which autospec cannot see
    from the class alone.

    Tests drive alternate paths through generate.return_value / .side_effect:
        mock_gateway.generate.return_value = make_backend_response(text="junk")
    to trigger StanceParseFailure, or a side_effect list to script a
    retry-then-succeed sequence.
