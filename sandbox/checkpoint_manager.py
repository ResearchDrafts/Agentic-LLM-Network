"""Checkpoint save/load (full_design_doc.md Sec 3.14).

Per-turn checkpoint of full agent state, so a failed run can resume rather
than restart. Overwrites the previous checkpoint each turn (not
append-only, unlike interactions.jsonl -- only the latest checkpoint is
ever needed for resume). Uses a write-to-.tmp-then-atomic-rename pattern
(Path.replace, atomic on POSIX) so a mid-write crash never leaves a torn
checkpoint file behind.
